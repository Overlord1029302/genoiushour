  <h2 >Aloe Vera</h2>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Asphodelaceae</em></p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Family:</strong> Asphodelaceae</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Native Range:</strong> Primarily found in the Arabian Peninsula but cultivated worldwide.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Description:</strong> A succulent plant with thick, fleshy leaves that contain a gel renowned for its soothing properties, often used in skin care and traditional medicine.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and needs very little water, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Aloe Vera has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, primarily for its skin-soothing properties.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Aloe vera (or Aloe barbadensis, or Barbados aloe) is an attractive house plant with spiky, fleshy leaves that are serrated at the edges. It's a succulent that hails from hot, arid regions of the world, and stores water in its leaves. It therefore doesn't need much watering, which makes it an excellent, low maintenance plant for beginners. </strong></p>

  <p class="plants"><strong> Aloe vera is also known as the first aid plant, as its sap is used to soothe burns, scalds, sunburn, skin irritations and insect bites. Cut away a leaf at the base, cut down its length and rub the sap directly on to skin.</strong></p>
    
  <p class="plants"><strong>Aloes look good on their own but combine really well with other succulents and cacti in a bright spot. In summer, you can put your aloe outside. It may produce a yellow tubular flower, but it's mostly grown for its attractive shape.</strong></p>
    
    <p class="plants"><strong>How to grow Aloe vera</strong>
    <strong>Grow your aloe in a bright spot. Aloes are killed by overwatering, so water sparingly. Water only when the top few centimetres of compost have dried out, allowing any excess to drain away fully, and don't water at all in winter.</strong></p>
